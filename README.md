# TUI

INFO C265 â€” Theory and Practice of Tangible User Interfaces (Fall 2023)

## Description

This repository contains a collection of works from the INFO C265 course. This class focuses on the use of an Arduino Uno as a microcomputer to program various tools and functions as a means to instruct digital and analog I/O.

Tools consisted of:
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- Jumper cables
- LEDs
- Various resistors
- Potentiometers
- Force Sensitive Resistors
- Photocells
- Servo motors
- DC motors
- Capacitors
- and more!

## Files

There are two separate sections: `Arduino` and `Processing`. `Arduino` contains the Arduino files to be ran on the Arduino IDE to program the device. `Processing` contains the files for the Processing visualization software, which was often used in conjunction with the Arduino. More often than not, we would utilize the `StandardFirmata` library to communicate between the two rather than sending over Serial.

The other folder is the `final project` folder. For my team's final project, we built "TUIMotion", an assistive device that aids those who have a poor sense of rhythm or beats to feel the beat directly on the wrist. We also have a visualization to go along with it. There are files that showcase those visualizations. Additionally, there is a pdf file on our CHI ACM-format research paper.
